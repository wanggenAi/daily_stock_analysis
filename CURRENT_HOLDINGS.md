## Daily review contract

Every trading-day holding review must refresh price, filings/material events, industry drivers, hard-logic status and valuation evidence. Production version `GEN_GE_V3_1_1_PRODUCTION` requires LOW/INVALID valuation confidence to return HOLD_REVIEW and keeps Hard Gate FAIL -> EXIT. Never infer a transaction from price movement or a prior plan.

## Latest hourly risk review — 2026-08-26 20:09 CST

- Fresh-data invariant: accepted 2026-08-26 closes were recovered for `603369 今世缘` (28.10), `600276 恒瑞医药` (46.74) and `600406 国电南瑞` (23.42). A clean independently accepted 2026-08-26 exact close was not recovered for `001316 润贝航科`; price-dependent action on that name therefore remains fail-closed.
- `603369 今世缘`: **HOLD_REVIEW / NO ADD**. 2026H1 revenue 64.35亿 (-7.41%), attributable profit 20.82亿 (-6.60%), deduct-profit -5.77%; operating cash flow 16.16亿 (+50.31%). Structural baijiu demand/channel pressure remains material, but Q2 partial recovery and improved cash flow mean no new formal REDUCE/EXIT trigger. 2026-08-26 accepted close 28.10 CNY.
- `001316 润贝航科`: **HOLD**. 2026H1 revenue 5.73亿 (+21.97%), attributable profit 1.12亿 (+44.82%), deduct-profit +45.14%, operating cash flow 1.19亿 (+26.52%). The 2026-08-24 withdrawal of the convertible-bond application is noted but company filings state no material adverse operating/financial effect; no thesis-break evidence. Exact 2026-08-26 close remains unverified, so no price-dependent ADD/REDUCE.
- `600276 恒瑞医药`: **HOLD_REVIEW**. 2026-08-26 accepted close 46.74 CNY. H1 deduct-profit and operating-cash-flow deterioration remain the key watch items; latest 2026-08-25 drug marketing-application acceptance is pipeline-supportive, not a sell trigger. No newly verified evidence establishes a durable innovation-pipeline/moat break or formal REDUCE/EXIT.
- `600406 国电南瑞`: **HOLD**. 2026-08-26 accepted close 23.42 CNY. No new material event falsifies grid digitization/UHV demand or grid-control/customer-certification moat; latest visible company item is the 2026H1 earnings-call notice. No REDUCE/EXIT trigger.
- **New REDUCE/EXIT:** NONE. **Holding thesis invalidation:** NONE newly established.

## Change history

- 2026-08-26 20:09 CST: refreshed all four confirmed holdings. Accepted same-day closes for 今世缘/恒瑞医药/国电南瑞; 润贝航科 exact close remained unavailable from independently accepted sources. No new REDUCE/EXIT or thesis invalidation.
- 2026-08-26 16:06 CST: hourly opportunity + holdings-risk refresh found no new REDUCE/EXIT trigger; price-dependent actions failed closed because a clean 2026-08-26 closing-price set was not independently accepted.
- 2026-08-26: GenGe V3.1.1 current-date dry-run returned HOLD_REVIEW / Confidence INVALID for all four confirmed holdings because refreshed normalized earnings, realistic/implied growth and neutral value were incomplete; no cost-basis or mechanical valuation sell was emitted.
- 2026-08-26: initialized from the latest recoverable broker-position evidence supplied by the user on 2026-08-25.
